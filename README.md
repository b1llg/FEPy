# FEPy: Simple Finite Element Solve in Python

FEPy is built to solve simple finite element (FE) problems. The code methodology is based around the book by André Fortin: [Les éléments finis de la théorie à la pratique](https://giref.ulaval.ca/afortin/elements_finis.pdf).

The main goal of FEPy is not be an efficient solve, but rather an easy to understand and easy to modify code to learn FE programming using the above book.
